## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

In addition to the installation requirements, you will also need:

* [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

### Guide

Run `lein new protojure <your project name>`

This instantiates a leiningen template that creates a runnable application hosting gRPC endpoints.

Refer to the README.md in the created project for instructions on how to use your own `.proto` Protocol Buffer and gRPC Service definitions.
